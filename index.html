            <h2>First act</h2>
            <p>Vivek, Karthik, Kaushik, and Uppi are childhood friends who dream of a career in filmmaking during their college days. But they eventually give up their plans and settle in other jobs. Vivek resigns his job and lives in isolation, still unable to get over his breakup with Shilpa; Karthik works as a manager in a club and plans on marrying his boss's daughter and settling in the US; Kaushik works as a dubbing artist and wants to become an actor; and Uppi works as a wedding editor. Karthik arranges a bachelor's party for four of them, where they run into Shirley, who joins them to conduct a casual promotional contest in which they narrate her their old friendship, their first short film work and Vivek's love story. Shirley invites them to an event in Goa and leaves.

            <h2>Second act</h2>
            <p>After a mishap at the party, they all end up in Goa. There they run into Shirley and her friend Dasha, who offer them a place to stay. Karthik loses the engagement ring given by his boss and needs â‚¹5 lakhs to buy a similar one. So they decide to participate in the Goa short film festival for the prize money. Vivek does not agree to make a romantic comedy film due to his past love failure with Shilpa, but he later agrees as they do not have an alternative. Karthik handles the cinematography, Uppi edits the film, and Kaushik and Dasha act in it. Unfortunately, Vivek could not get out of his past and gives a sad ending to the film. He later gives up on the project as he fears the negative feedback. At this time, when Vivek drank and slept, the remaining three wanted to change the sad ending, but they were caught by patrolling police and end up in a police station.</p>
            <h2>Third act</h2>
            <p>The next day while editing the film, Vivek wakes up, gets angry at them for changing his ending and yells at Karthik, who is in an online engagement. He reveals that they actually came to Goa because the drunken Karthik requested him. Karthik realizes that he is losing everything else for the social status, calls off his marriage and reconciles his friendship with Vivek. Kaushik gets the confidence to act in films, and Uppi becomes an editor. Vivek finally gets over his breakup, reflects his feelings on Shirley and becomes a cool person without anger issues. After working on a few short films, they start their first feature film, Pelli Choopulu.</p>
