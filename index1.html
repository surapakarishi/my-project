    <h2>PLOT</h2>
        <hr>
    <h2>First act</h2>
        <p>Prasanth goes to Chitra's house for a matchmaking event.
             He is a guy who completes his BTech by clearing many subjects
              for almost 5 years, but he is also lazy and incapable of doing
               any work. His dream is to become a chef and open a restaurant
               , but he doesn't get any support from his father. Chitra is a
                very focused girl who works hard to fulfil her dreams of going
                 to Australia. However, her father shows no interest, as she is
                  a girl. When both of them meet at the matchmaking event her
                   younger cousin, Subhash, accidentally locks the door which 
                   jams very often and they get stuck eventually. 
                   To pass time, they talk about their past.

            Chitra reveals that she was in love with a North Indian guy named
             Vikram. They both wanted to start a food truck business.
              Vikram went to Delhi to talk with his father about their love 
              and business. Meanwhile, Chitra started her plan eagerly, and was 
              ready to surprise Vikram by buying the truck. Then things went wrong
               and Vikram did not come back overpowered by greed of getting dowry.
                Chitra and her father waited for him but when they realised Vikram
                 wasn't coming back, her father decided to get her married to
                  someone else.
        </p>
    <h2>Second act</h2>
        <p>On his turn, Prasanth reveals that he was unemployed and always went
             out with his two friends. He, along with his friends, made cooking
              videos, as he is passionate about cooking. But it wasn't profitable
               enough so, they plan to make prank videos and were caught 
               red-handed by Prashant's father, which ended their plan.
                He then got a job in a call centre after he was recommended
                 by his father. He started going out with a girl to show off
                  to his friends, but she cheated on him. He found out about 
                  it only when her second boyfriend called him at work, and 
                  quit his job after having a fight with his boss.

            It is then revealed that Prasanth came to the wrong address for 
            his matchmaking event. Later, Prasanth goes to his actual matchmaking
             event, which was with a rich family. Meanwhile, Chitra tells the guy
              coming to her matchmaking event that she's not interested in
               marriage. The family of Prasanth's bride wanted him to be able 
               to run a business, so he and Chitra decide to operate the food
                truck themselves, with Prasanth as the chef, and Chitra in charge
                 of the business side of things. At first, they face many 
                 difficulties, mainly through Prasanth's and his friends'
                  laziness as well as fighting with Chitra and giving up the 
                  food truck.
            
        </p>
    <h2>Third act</h2>
        <p>Prasanth visits Chitra's house and informs her father that he
             should be proud to have such a responsible daughter. He also 
             claims that if he ever gets a child he would wish to have daughter 
             like Chitra and insists him that he let her pursue her dreams.
              Chitra understands the good nature of Prasanth and later convinces
               his father that he is a natural cook by cooking them Prasanth's
                recipe. They kickstart their business with the support from both 
                their parents. After this, their food truck becomes a smashing
                 success. In the process, they fall in love without realising
                  it, but both of them are engaged to other people, so they drift
                   apart. After realising they love each other, they come back 
                   together through a radio show organised by their friend, with
                    the support of their family and friends.
