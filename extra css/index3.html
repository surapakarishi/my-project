        <h2>PLOT</h2>
        <hr>
        <h2>First act</h2>
        <p>Sundar comes from an orthodox Brahmin family. During his childhood, Sundar is duped by a fraudster who promises him a role in an upcoming film starring Chiranjeevi that'd be shot in the US. Therefore, his family develops deep skepticism towards such ventures. Sundar grows up to be an employee at an ad agency. He tries to persuade his colleague Soumya to give up the opportunity to go to the US so that he can take her place and fulfil his dream. But on Soumya's insistence, he tells her the actual reason. Sundar is in love with his childhood sweetheart Leela, a Christian who is now a professional photographer. She gets close to Sundar when her ex-boyfriend Vamsi cheats on her. Sundar and Leela decide to marry but since they belong to different religions, Sundar sketches a plan to convince their parents. As a part of it, they lie to their families about the reason they are leaving for the US. Soumya is convinced and lets Sundar take her place by lying to their manager.

            A month after arriving in the US, Sundar lies to his parents that he has azoospermia but Leela is ready to marry him despite this while Leela lies to her parents that she is pregnant. They return to India immediately on their parents' demand but Sundar and Leela's bags are exchanged. Sundar's father gathers their relatives to tell them about Sundar's impotency but they come across Leela's bag which raises suspicion. Leela's parents also recognize that her boyfriend is Hindu by looking at a Hanuman sticker on Sundar's bag. They force her to take a pregnancy test which Leela fudges to be positive using a bottle of Mountain Dew.</p>
            <h2>Second act</h2>
        <p>Sundar's father tries to take him to several doctors to treat Sundar, all of whom rebuke him listening to his story, until they meet Dr. Guru, Sundar's childhood friend. Guru lies that it may take 10â€“15 years to treat Sundar. Meanwhile, Leela's parents fix her marriage with Joseph, a family friend, who accepts Leela's pregnancy. Sundar tries to talk Joseph out of it but in vain. Intimidated by Joseph, Sundar reveals that Leela being pregnant was a lie. Joseph informs the same to Leela's parents. He asks Leela to tell the truth by swearing on The Bible but Leela's father calls off the wedding as he doesn't want an outsider to suspect his daughter. With no option left, both their families reluctantly accept Leela and Sundar's marriage while both remain unaware of the other family's reason to do so. During their meeting, the parents come very close to discovering the contradicting stories, but Sundar's parents help in treating the pregnancy cramps of Leela's sister Pushpa, thus bringing their families closer.

            Sometime later, Joseph reveals to Leela's mother that it was Sundar who told him that Leela wasn't pregnant. She takes Leela to the hospital and gets her pregnancy checked, and to Leela's surprise, the result turns out to be positive. Sundar and Leela are confused about the result as they have not consummated. They go for a final check-up to plan accordingly. The doctor tells that Leela is suffering from dysgerminoma, a type of ovarian cancer which often results in false positives about pregnancy. The tumor has to be surgically removed from her ovaries following which Leela might not bear children. Sundar confesses to Leela's father that they lied about pregnancy all along.</p>
            <h2>Third act</h2>
        <p>Sundar's father and grandmother now want to call off the marriage citing Leela's issue. However, Sundar's mother exposes their hypocrisy as they were ready to marry off Sundar despite his perceived impotency. She feels that Sundar's happiness is more important than their traditions and having children. Sundar's grandmother approves of the marriage by playing the Veena which she gave up post Sundar's childhood fiasco. Delighted, Sundar runs to meet Leela who has undergone the surgery and they decide to get married.

            They reach Amelia Island for the wedding to fulfil Leela's wish. Sundar confesses that the anonymous postcard which Leela received in her childhood was sent by him while Leela tells that she knows it was Sundar who sent the Postcard and starts saying, she said a lie to him , Carla is actually her tution teacher and her dream to have her wedding on Amelia Island was just a made-up story.</p>
