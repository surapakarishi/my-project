    <h2>PLOT</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>First act</h2>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Decision making? Well that's tough given that options before you are equally luring. That's near to impossible <br>
        for a guy, Aravind Krishna (Sree Vishnu) is a guy affected to Borderline personality disorder a fickle-minded <br>
        person since childhood who gets confused when faced with regular options. The kind that could answer everything <br>
        on a theoretical paper but returns the objective paper blank. Not just getting confused, like any one of us generally <br>
        happen to be,  but yearns for the option that he didn't choose after deciding. To add to this, an incident from his <br>
        12th year makes him uncomfortable to talk to or be around girls. As he becomes older, the situation doesn't get any better.<br>
        Aravind, now 29 years old, almost gives up on the hope of getting married after messing up 12 match makings. Reluctantly, <br>
        he attends the 13th and to his surprise, he finds himself at ease when he talks to Swetcha (Nivetha Pethuraj), <br>
        a clear-headed straight forward girl in contrast to Aravind.</p>
    <h2>Second act</h2>
    <p style="font-weight:bold ;">Swetcha who sees the plainness in his heart agrees to marry him. The two spend some time together before getting engaged, <br>
        as they get to know about each other they start liking each other. Being with Swetcha helps Aravind to get over his discomfort <br>
        with girls. While waiting on their engagement, Aravind is obliged to go to Mumbai for a project. On his way, he meets a <br>
        joyous and unpredictable girl, called Renuka (Amrutha Srinivasan), from Vijayawada and architectural student who leaves an <br>
        impression during their bus journey, but disappears as he reaches Mumbai. She is a strong believer in destiny and Aravind too <br>
        subconsciously starts believing in it and starts searching for her in Mumbai. The same destiny has them meet again in Mumbai <br>
        and she became a roommate with Aravind along with Saki (Kireeti Damaraju) and some other friends. Meanwhile, Aravind finds <br>
        himself drawn to her as he spends more and more time with her. He became infatuated with her and one night they both kiss <br>
        later she shares her past that he had a boy friend who died in an accident. Then she confess her feelings on Aravind later <br>
        she Vacated the Apartment next day. The same night in the confused state of mind Aravind calls off the engagement with Swetcha <br>
        then suddenly manages it as prank. Then in the next day Swetcha gives a surprise visit to Mumbai. She befriends all of his friends. <br>
        Later she asks about Renu however they manage but Swetcha finds her in a restaurant they both become good friends.</p>
    <h2>Third act</h2>
    <p style="font-weight:bold ;">Later while going back Swecha admits to Aravind that she understands everything about Aravind and Renu and shows anguish on him and <br>
        she goes to Hyderabad. In Hyderabad Aravind's father (Sivaji Raja) makes him realise that how the risk of choice making will become <br>
        a positive change in life. Then Aravind for the first time took decision and came to apologise Swetcha but she avoids him. <br>
        Later he meets Renu and confess his feelings on Swetcha and apologise Renu. Then, Renu encourages Aravind to propose to Swetcha <br>
        and they part their ways. The same night Aravind went to Swetcha's home to talk about it but her mom (Anitha Chowdary) tells him <br>
        that she is on a bus which is going out of station. Then Aravind catches the bus along with his father successfully. Then he proves <br>
        that he overcomes his disorder and apologise her. Then, finally, Swetcha accept his proposal with a tight slap. Meanwhile, his father <br>
        comically encounters the other passenger (Nara Rohit) and invites him to his son's marriage. Aravind and Swetcha get married and lived <br>
        happily.</p>
